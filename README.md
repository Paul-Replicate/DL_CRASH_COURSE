# DL\_CRASH\_COURSE
Disclaimer: None of the course material are mine. These materials were found after exhaustively searching the internet and what seemed to be free and relevant to the work we do.
Note: The directories of the individuals are people from the Lindert Lab who showed interest in working through this crash course with me. For the interested individuals I created a directory (per person with their first name). The created directories for the respective individuals to upload their tutorials, examples, notes, assignments, papers and/or problems they want to talk about.
## Week 1:
### Tutorials:
- https://jovian.ai/learn/deep-learning-with-pytorch-zero-to-gans/lesson/lesson-1-pytorch-basics-and-linear-regression (This covers the basics of pytorch, can be skimmed through super fast.)
- https://jovian.ai/learn/deep-learning-with-pytorch-zero-to-gans/lesson/lesson-2-working-with-images-and-logistic-regression
- - This tutorial is more fun and covers the following:
- - - Working with images in PyTorch (using the MNIST dataset).
- - - Splitting a dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
- - - Creating PyTorch models with custom logic by extending the nn.Module class.
- - - Interpreting model outputs as probabilities using Softmax and picking predicted labels.
- - - Picking a useful evaluation metric (accuracy) and loss function (cross-entropy) for classification problems.
- - - Setting up a training loop that also evaluates the model using the validation set.
- - - Testing the model manually on randomly picked examples.
- - - Saving and loading model checkpoints to avoid retraining from scratch.
